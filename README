Network Traffic Management Using Python Sockets

This project simulates network traffic management using Python socket programming. It demonstrates how a server monitors incoming traffic, detects congestion, and controls client sending rates to reduce packet overload.

->Features
Client–server communication using TCP sockets
Real-time traffic monitoring (packets/sec)
Congestion detection using threshold-based logic
Dynamic traffic control by adjusting client send rates
Traffic visualization using Matplotlib

->Technologies Used
Python
Socket Programming
Multithreading
Matplotlib

->Performance Metrics
Traffic Rate (Packets/sec)
Congestion Detection
Throughput Improvement via Rate Control

->How It Works
Multiple clients send packets to the server
Server counts packets every second
If traffic exceeds threshold, congestion is detected
Clients reduce sending rate
Traffic stabilizes and throughput improves

->How to Run
python server.py
python client.py

Run multiple clients in separate terminals.

->Output
The server displays real-time traffic statistics and plots a graph showing network traffic over time.

->Future Improvements

Multi-client congestion feedback
Packet loss calculation
Latency measurement
Advanced congestion algorithms
